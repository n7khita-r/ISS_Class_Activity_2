# the program finds all paris such that a^3 + b^3 = 1729. 
# in function it first takes cube root of target and estimates largest possible a or b
# loops through vals of a and b from 1 to maxnumber
# checks if a^3 + b^3 satisfies the property and equals 1729. if yes, it is stored in list
# list is returned, iterated thru and printed in good readable format
